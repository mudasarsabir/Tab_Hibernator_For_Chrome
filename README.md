# Tab Hibernator Chrome Extension

This extension allows you to hibernate inactive tabs to save memory and improve browser performance. Inactive, non-pinned tabs are replaced with a lightweight 'hibernation' page. When you navigate back to the tab, it automatically reloads its original content.

## How to Install

1.  **Download the files:** Create a folder on your computer named `Tab Hibernator` and save all the provided files inside it. Make sure to create an `images` subfolder for the icon files.
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top right corner, turn on the "Developer mode" toggle switch.
4.  **Load the Extension:** Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `Tab Hibernator` folder you created.

## How to Use

1.  Click the moon icon for the extension in your Chrome toolbar.
2.  Click the "Hibernate Inactive Tabs" button.
3.  All your inactive and non-audible tabs will now be in a sleep state.
4.  To restore a tab, simply click on it, and it will reload automatically.
